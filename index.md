This is where I will record my progress on my final project for DACSS 758, Text-as-Data.

My background is in sociology, and I’m especially interested in family sociology. I’m interested in household labor and queer family construction. For this project, I’m thinking about how I can investigate representations of family in media and see how they have evolved over time. I would like to see how portrayals of non-traditional families (single parents, step-families, adoption, queer parents, chosen families, etc.) are approached in media and see what I can learn about changing norms in American family life. 

My research question is: how have non-traditional family structures been portrayed in popular media over time, and what insights can we gain from these portrayals about changing norms and culture? 

To investigate this research question, I intend to use the TV Corpus available at English-Corpora.org. Since this is a very large corpus of TV show transcripts starting from the 1950s, I think it will have more than enough data for me to work with. I'm thinking of focusing on sitcoms, as I feel that they often are a good representation of what is considered normative, as well as what is considered to be funny, in popular culture over time. Additionally, I'm thinking of also looking at news media to see if similar trends show up between different types of media and understand to what extent conversations about family in news and popular culture overlap. To get a corpus of news media, I would turn to the Proquest databases; in particular, it seems like the GenderWatch database might be very useful. I don't think this would be too much work for data collection and processing, but I'm unsure if this idea to take a comparative approach might be too complicated down the line and if it would make more sense to focus on just one corpus.
