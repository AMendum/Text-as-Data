# Text-as-Data
This is where I will record my progress on my final project for DACSS 758, Text-as-Data.

My background is in sociology, and I’m especially interested in family sociology. I’m interested in household labor and queer family construction. For this project, I’m thinking about how I can investigate representations of family in media and see how they have evolved over time. 

My research question is: how have non-traditional family structures been portrayed in popular media over time, and what insights can we gain from these portrayals about changing norms and culture? 

To investigate this research question, I will be looking at the TV Corpus available at English-Corpora.org. Since this is a very large corpus of TV show transcripts starting from the 1950s, I think it will have more than enough data for me to work with. Additionally, if I find myself wanting to make this project a little more complicated, I might look into portrayals in news media as well and take a comparative approach. If I do choose to do that, I should be able to access news transcripts fairly easily as well through Proquest.
